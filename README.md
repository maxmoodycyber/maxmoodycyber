## Max Moody

Hello I'm Max! An Aspiring Cybersecurity Professional looking to make a difference.
I am pretty inactive on Github and it's more than likely that most of my repos will be private regardless.
Here is some facts about me!

- 👀 I’m currently interested in penetration testing and overall cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic penetration testing through CTFs and other related material.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to cybersecurity and potentially other things. Just shoot me a message and ask!
- Further contact information and further information as a whole will likely be left later. Currently focusing on my studies as much as I can!

Thank you for visiting my profile!
